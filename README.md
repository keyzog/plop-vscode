## Installation

-  Open the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).
-  Search for Plop Path.
-  Click Install.

#### Setting up Plop

We recommend using [plopit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plopit), which this extension is specifically designed to complement. However, it can also work with the standard Plop setup.

**ðŸ’§Installing Plopit**
To install plopit globally, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g plopit
```

---

**ðŸ’§Alternatively you can use standard plop package**

1. To install Plop.js, use the following command:

```bash
# global install:
npm install plop -g

# or instal for current project:
npm install plop --save-dev
```

2. Create a new file called plopfile.js at the root of your project (in the same folder as package.json):

```js
// plopfile.js
module.exports = function (plop) {
	plop.setGenerator("myTemplate", {
		prompts: [
			{
				// Always include a "path" prompt when using this extension,
				// as it will automatically be answered for the user.
				type: "input",
				name: "path",
				message: "Template destination path",
			},
			{
				type: "input",
				name: "name",
				message: "File name",
			},
		],
		actions: [
			{
				type: "add",
				path: "{{path}}/{{name}}.js",
				templateFile: "plop-templates/component.tsx.hbs",
			},
		],
	});
};
```

## Usage

-  Right-click on any file or folder in the VS Code explorer.
-  Select "Run Plop Here..." from the context menu.
-  The configured Plop command will run in a new terminal with the selected path.

## Settings

The extension provides the following settings for customization:

-  **plop-path.plopCommand:** The command to run Plop. This can be customized to any Plop command you want to use. By default: `plopit` if you use plopit installed globally or `npx plop --` for default plop.

   -  **Default:** plopit
   -  **Description:** The command to run Plop. This can be customized to any Plop command you want to use. For example, if the command is `plopit`, and the path argument name is `path`, the generated command will be `plopit --path <directory_path>`. Command template: `${plopCommand} --${pathArgName} <directory_path>`.

-  **plop-path.pathArgName:** The argument name for the path. This is used to pass the directory path to the Plop command.

   -  **Default:** path
   -  **Description:** The argument name for the path. This is used to pass the directory path to the Plop command.
